# ICU-Lua
Transpiler and interpreter built on top of a custom compiler for the purposes of open-source public, free medicine.

The purposes of this project is to build an open-source channel for medicine with computer scientists.

We like to provide assistance where we see fit. As far as I'm concerned, there's various lacking tools available
to the public due to the nature of the medical profession. Anything built in a lab will be by it's very nature,
an IP of that lab.

Our mission: open-source health insurance

Our goal: open-source medical tools for the public

Our standards: only of highest quality.

Where to begin....

Insulin, water, prescriptions, diagnostics, ML/AI systems that can detect and treat various symptoms
on the fly. And more on the way!

Optically, this isn't that bad... We are basically saying we want to provide the highest level of
medical care for any general patient under the pre-condition that they understand the nature of
what open-source means: it's free, for a reason.

Cheers,

LBB
